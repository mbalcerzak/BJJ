let yourself down at the last tourney or how this beginner white belt has just passed your guard it s when instead you re concentrated so much on what you re doing that nothing else matters you just are there in your gym your home away from home rolling it s when you don t think about what you re gonna do next you only do something next and next and next you only do something now i love this
