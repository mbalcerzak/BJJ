# Brasilian Jiu Jitsu Survey Results

I am passionate about BJJ and Natural Language Processing and I found a perfect project to combine both. Data I received from the author of ["Grumpy Grappler" blog](https://philosophycommons.typepad.com/the_grumpy_grappler/bjj-survey/) contains 63 columns and 807 unique answers. It's available in an interactive dashboard so that everyone can focus on parts they're th emost interested in

I visualised my favourite quesiton ('Q19':'What is your favorite part about training?') in a wordcloud (in BJJ belt colours). I think It captures well what we all love about that gentle art

### Grappling with the data:
- misspellings (or loose question interpretation: I am afraid neither Texas or 'Murika are a country :P)
- missing data
- different names for the same BJJ techniques
